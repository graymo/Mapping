# What you'll need
In order to carry out the steps in this guide, it will be helpful to have a few things:
* Data you would like to display visually on a map
* A spreadsheet (Google Sheets is preferred)
* A github account ([SPCKW has their own organization hub](https://github.com/info-waterloo-region))
* A basic knowledge of [html](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

Depending on how far you would like to go with the mapping project, you may need a more in depth understanding of a variety of coding languages.

If you wish to read up some of the resources in advance, we will be working with the following filetypes and tools:
* [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) filetype
* [JSON](http://json.org/) and [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) formats
* [GitHub](https://help.github.com) repository hosting and code building
* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) for javascript map building
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for webpage construction
