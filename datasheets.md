# Data and Spreadsheets
The first, and arguably most important, step is to organize your data in a clean and consistent manner. For the sake of future steps, it is useful to use Google Sheets.

1. Freeze the first row (View/Freeze->1 row) to secure the column headers at the top of the sheet.

2. Set up your columns with headers. These should be one word and lowercase. If you need more than one word, style like `firstSecond` (no space, second word capitalized). The absolute basic & essential columns are:
  * latitude
  * longitude
  * label or popupContent
